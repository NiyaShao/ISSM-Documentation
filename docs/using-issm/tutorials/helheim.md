## Modeling Helheim Glacier
### Goals

- Create an ice-flow model of Helheim Glacier (southeast Greenland)
- Run an inversion model to infer basal friction

### Introduction
In this example, the main goal is to parameterize and model a real Greenland outlet glacier. In order to build an operational simulation of Helheim Glacier, we will follow these steps:

- Define the model region
- Create a mesh
- Parameterize the model
- Invert for friction coefficient
- Plot results

Files needed for this tutorial can be found in `<ISSM_DIR>/examples/Helheim/`. The `runme.m` file contains the structure of the simulation, while the `.par` file includes most parameters needed for the model set-up. The `.exp` file contains coordinates that define the model domain boundaries.

Observed datasets needed for the parameterization need to be downloaded.

### Mesh
The first step is to create the model domain outline and mesh.

In the `runme.m` file, the mesh is generated in a multi-step process. Open the `runme.m` file and make sure that the variable `steps`, at the top of the file, is set to `steps = [1]`. In the code, you will see that in Step 1 the following actions are implemented:


- Create a uniform mesh
- Refine the mesh using anisotropic mesh refinement based on surface velocity
- Set the mesh parameters
- Load observed surface velocities
- Interpolate velocity onto a coarse mesh. Adapt the mesh to minimize error in velocity interpolation
- Save the model

Execute the `runme.m` file to perform step 1. Plot the mesh with:

````
plotmodel(md, 'data', 'mesh')
````

You should see the following figure, with finer resolution in the two main branches of Helheim and its main trunk:

Try experimenting with different values in the mesh generation to create finer or coarser meshes.

### Parameterization
Most of the model parameterization is done through a different file (`Greenland.par`). In this example, we parameterize the following model fields:

- Geometry (ice surface elevation and bed topography, using BedMachine)
- Initialization parameters
- Material parameters
- Friction coefficient
- Boundary conditions

Run step 2 in the `runme.m` file to perform the parameterization.

### Inversion for basal friction
The friction coefficient is inferred from the surface velocity using the following friction law:

<div align="center"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?
\mathbf{ \tau }_b = -\beta^{2} N^r \|\mathbf{v_b}\|^{s-1}\mathbf{v_b}" alt="Equation 1"></div>


- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbf{ \tau }_b" alt="Equation 2"> : Basal stress (basal drag)
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?N" alt="Equation 3">: Effective pressure (ice overburden pressure - water pressure at the bed)
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v_b" alt="Equation 4">: Basal velocity (equal to surface velocity in SSA approximation)
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r" alt="Equation 6">: Exponent (equals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?q/p" alt="Equation 5"> of the parameter file)
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?s" alt="Equation 8">: Exponent (equals <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?1/p" alt="Equation 7"> of the parameter file)

The procedure for the inversion is as follows:

- Velocity is computed from the SSA approximation
- Misfit of the cost function is computed
- Friction coefficient is modified following the gradient of the cost function

All the parameters that can be adjusted for the inversion are in `md.inversion`.

Run step 3. This will take a few minutes to run. Plot the resulting velocity and friction coefficient:

````
plotmodel(md, 'data', md.initialization.vel, 'title', 'Surface Velocity (m/yr)', ...
	'data', md.friction.coefficient, 'title', 'Friction Coefficient')
````
You should see something similar to the figure below:

<div style="display:flow-root"><img style="float:left;width:100.00%" src="/ISSM-Documentation/assets/img/docs/using-issm/tutorials/helheim/figure_vel_fric.png" alt="Figure 2: figure_vel_fric"></div>
Try experimenting with different cost-function values and other parameters in `md.inversion`.

Now that you have run an inversion for basal friction and have a working stress-balance model of Helheim Glacier, you are ready for the next tutorial on simulating subglacial hydrology at Helheim using the SHAKTI model.
