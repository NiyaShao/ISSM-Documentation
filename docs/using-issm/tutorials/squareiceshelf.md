## Square Ice Shelf
This is an example of velocity computation in steady state for a square ice shelf. First, launch MATLAB. In the left sidebar, select `ISSM_DIR` (the directory in which ISSM is stored) as your Current Directory. Then, navigate to `examples/SquareIceshelf`, which you can also do via the left sidebar or by running the following in the MATLAB Command Window:
````
>> cd examples/SquareIceShelf
````

You can create an empty model structure by running:
````
>> md = model;
````

Create a mesh of the domain outline with a resolution of 50,000 meters:
````
>> md = triangle(md, 'DomainOutline.exp', 50000);
````

Define the glacier system as an ice shelf (no island):
````
>> md = setmask(md, 'all', '');
````

Parameterize the model with the file `Square.par` (which you can see exists in the current directory by inspecting the left sidebar):
````
>> md = parameterize(md, 'Square.par');
````

Define all elements as SSA:
````
>> md = setflowequation(md, 'SSA', 'all');
````

Compute the velocity field of the ice shelf:
````
>> md = solve(md, 'Stressbalance');
````

Finally, generate a plot of the velocity:

*MATLAB*
```mat
>> plotmodel(md, 'data', md.results.StressbalanceSolution.Vel);
```

*Python*
```py
plotmodel(md, data=md.results.StressbalanceSolution.Vel)
```
